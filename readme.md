## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Java 17**: [Download JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html)
- **MySQL 8.0.33**: [Download MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/)
- **Maven**: [Install Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
- **Git**: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ruvini-Rangathara/Mega-City-Cab-CIS6003
   cd mega-city-cab
   ```

2. **Set Up MySQL**:
    - Create a database named `mega_city_cab`.
    - Import the schema from `src/main/resources/schema.sql`.
    - Update `application.properties` with your MySQL credentials:
      ```properties
      db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mega_city_cab
      db.username=root
      db.password=your_password
      ```

3. **Build the Project**:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
    - Deploy the WAR file (e.g., `target/mega-city-cab.war`) to a Java EE server (e.g., Tomcat).
    - Access via `http://localhost:8080/mega-city-cab`.

5. **Login**:
    - Default credentials: `john.doe@megacitycab.com` / `admin123` (change immediately!).

## üîß CI/CD Pipeline

The Mega City Cab System features a robust **CI/CD pipeline** powered by GitHub Actions, ensuring seamless automation of testing, building, and deployment across multiple environments. This pipeline enhances development efficiency and reliability by enforcing strict branch management and automated workflows.

- **Branch Strategy**:
    - `dev`: Development environment for new features.
    - `stage`: Staging environment for testing releases.
    - `release`: Pre-production environment for final validation.
    - `main`: Production environment for live deployment.

- **Key Processes**:
    - **Merge Validation**: Enforces strict pull request (PR) rules (e.g., PRs to `main` must come from `release`, `release` from `stage`, `stage` from `dev`).
    - **Unit Testing**: Executes tests for the `UserDaoImpl` layer with a MySQL service container.
    - **Building**: Compiles and packages the project, skipping tests for deployment builds.
    - **Deployment**: Automates deployment to `dev`, `stage`, `preprod`, and `production` environments based on branch pushes.

- **Monitoring**: Check the build status and detailed logs on the [Actions tab](https://github.com/Ruvini-Rangathara/Mega-City-Cab-CIS6003/actions) for real-time insights into pipeline execution.

This streamlined pipeline ensures high-quality code delivery with minimal manual intervention, making it a cornerstone of the project‚Äôs modern development practices.

## üîí Security

The Mega City Cab System is fortified with a comprehensive security framework to protect sensitive data and ensure system integrity:

- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are securely hashed using a strong algorithm (e.g., SHA-256 with salt), preventing unauthorized access even in the event of a data breach. Salting ensures unique hashes for identical passwords, enhancing protection.

- **Soft Delete Mechanism**: Implements soft delete for all records, marking them with a `deletedAt` timestamp instead of permanent deletion. This preserves data history and allows recovery if needed, supporting audit trails.

- **Security Filter Chain**: A robust **Security Filter Chain** is integrated using Java EE servlet filters to enforce security at every level:

- **Audit Logging**: Tracks user actions (e.g., login, CRUD operations) with timestamps (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`) for monitoring and forensic analysis.

These measures create a secure, resilient environment tailored to the needs of a cab management system handling sensitive customer and operational data.
